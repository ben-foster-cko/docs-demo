  summary: Void a payment
  description: |
    Voids a payment if supported by the payment method.

    For card payments, void requests are processed asynchronously. You can use [webhooks](#tag/Webhook-Management) to be notified if the void is successful.

    One of the following webhooks will be sent:
      - [Payment Voided](#/paths/~1payment_voided/post)
      - [Payment Void Declined](#/paths/~1payment_void_declined/post)
  parameters:
    - in: path
      name: id
      type: string
      required: true
      description: The payment identifier
      pattern: "^(pay)_(\\w{26})$"

    required: true

      application/json:
