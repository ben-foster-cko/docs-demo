    # Introduction

    The Checkout.com API is built on HTTP. Our API is RESTful. It has predictable
    resource URLs.  It returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors.  It also
    accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body.


    You can use your favorite HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use Checkout's API,
    or you can use one of our SDKs (currently available in
    [PHP](https://github.com/checkout/checkout-php-library),
    [.NET](https://github.com/checkout/checkout-net-library) and
    [Java](https://github.com/checkout/checkout-java-library)).

    # Authentication

    When you sign up for an account, you are given a secret and public API key
    pair. You authenticate with the Checkout.com API by providing the appropriate key in
    the request Authorization header.


    Never share your secret keys. Keep them guarded and secure.

      Webhooks are designed to notify your systems when certain/all registered
      events happen in near real-time.

      They allow you to collect information about those events. Checkout.com can send
      these information via POST to an URL of your choice.
